Q:
Write a function to find the first occurrence of a target number in a sorted list that may contain duplicates using binary search.

# Example:
# Input: [1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6], target = 4
# Output: 2  (index of first 4)





Q:
Given a list of words, return the top 3 most frequent words in descending order of frequency.

# Example:
# Input: ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"]
# Output: ["apple", "banana", "orange"]




Given a list of strings, sort them by their last character. If two strings have the same last character, maintain their original order (stable sort).

# Example:
# Input: ["car", "apple", "banana", "cat"]
# Output: ["banana", "apple", "car", "cat"]
# ('a' from banana, 'e' from apple, 'r' from car, 't' from cat)
