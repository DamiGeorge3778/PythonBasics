Question 1: Lists and Sets
Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing only the unique elements, preserving their original order.

Example Input:

[4, 5, 6, 4, 2, 5, 7]  

Expected Output:

[4, 5, 6, 2, 7]

Question 2: Dictionaries
Given a list of words, write a function that returns a dictionary with the words as keys and their lengths as values.
Example Input:

["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

Expected Output:

{'apple': 5, 'banana': 6, 'cherry': 6}

Question 3: Recursion and Functions
Write a recursive Python function to compute the sum of all elements in a nested list. The list can contain integers or other lists.

Example Input:

[1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]], 7]

Expected Output:

28

Question 4: Do sorting using recursion
